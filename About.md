## Biography!

My name is Cristobal Escobar, and I am a passionate computer science student at Washington State University with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence. I am known for being a hardworking, persevering, and determined individual who never shies away from a challenge.

As a minority immigrant student, I have faced numerous obstacles that have only made me more determined to succeed. Despite having to learn a new language while pursuing my education and being independent, I am dedicated to obtaining a computer science degree and securing a job with a prestigious company such as Apple, Microsoft, or Google.

My ultimate goal is to not only achieve success but also help others achieve their goals. I know firsthand the struggles of being a minority in the computer science field, which is why I am motivated to become successful and contribute in any positive way to society, especially to the minorityâ€™s communities. I believe that everyone deserves an opportunity to follow their dreams, and I am committed to contributing to positive change in the industry for the long term.
